move-window
===========

Move a window one monitor to the right or left

This program depends on:
* perl
* wmctrl
* xdotool
* xrandr
* xwininfo
* xprop

This program may or may not work on your system.

I am happy to accept pull requests if you can improve the program in some way (so long as it still works on my computer).

Sorry for my lack of serious Perl skills - I originally learned Perl back when versions were still numbered like 5.004, and my most recent Perl experiences were with a company running 5.8 (but their massive library of existing code must have been from the Perl 4 era).

Some of the commands and logic were inspired from the script in this post:

Which was apparently inspired by this post:
